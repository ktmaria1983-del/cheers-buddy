        <strong>Cheers Buddy</strong> is a safe online space where real people cheer for real
        progress — especially beginners taking their first steps. Whether you’re learning to code,
        sewing your first project, building fitness habits, or creating art, you’ll find
        encouragement instead of comparison.

      <p className="mb-6">
        Every small win deserves recognition. Post your milestones, receive cheers from others, and
        cheer them back. Our goal is to make positivity visible and measurable — one clap at a time.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        We believe communities grow stronger when celebration replaces competition. Specialists can
        mentor newcomers, showing that guidance and kindness can scale together.
      </p>

      <p className="italic text-slate-400">
        You rise, others cheer — and together we make progress contagious.
